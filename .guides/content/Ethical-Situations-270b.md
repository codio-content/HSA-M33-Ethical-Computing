Research and discuss several situations to determine the ethical implications.

1) A popular auto maker programmed the computers of it's cars to operate differently during an emissions test than in actual driving conditions.  This allowed them to pass emissions tests with cars that would not otherwise pass.  What are the ethical implications of software that can "cheat the system"?

2) An NSA contractor stole and released classified materials about secret government programs.  The materials show that the government is routinely spying on its own citizens.  The materials even show wiretapping of the heads of state of our allies.  Was the contractor right to bring such issues to light?  What right does the government have to spy on its own citizens?

3) A record company installs a digital rights management (DRM) program on their CDs so that people who purchase the music cannot pirate copies.  The DRM accidently acts like a virus, corrupting the computers that it is installed on.  What are the rights of a person who purchases music to distribute that music?  What are the implications for a company that installs malware in an attempt to protect their own intellectual property?
